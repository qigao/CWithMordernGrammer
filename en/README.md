# English Edition

This directory contains the English edition of *C with Modern Grammar*.

Chapter filenames such as `ch-13.md` are stable source IDs, not visible chapter numbers. Publication order is defined by [BOOK_MANIFEST.txt](./BOOK_MANIFEST.txt), while the displayed chapter number comes from each file's H1.
