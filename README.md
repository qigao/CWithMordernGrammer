# C with Modern Grammar

**Know more before execution; do less at runtime**

[中文](./README_CN.md) | **English**

**Manuscripts:** [Chinese chapters](./cn/) · [English chapters](./en/)

This book is for C programmers who already know the language.

It does not try to turn C into another language, and it does not treat macros, IDLs, graphs, or Lean as ends in themselves.

Its central question is:

> **When the same stable knowledge is duplicated across C code, metadata, HTTP/RPC bindings, plugins, mocks, and optimizers, how can we lift that knowledge into finite, explicit, checkable IRs, consume as much of it as possible before execution, and still end in ordinary C?**

## Three IRs

The book now revolves around three distinct semantic layers:

~~~text
DataBind Contract IR
    what the program promises

CMeta Native Semantic IR
    what the C implementation is

CFlow Execution IR
    how admitted computation is composed, checked, and optimized
~~~

They are not three runtimes.

A typical path is:

~~~text
DataBind Service
        +
CMeta FunctionDesc
        ↓
BindingPlan / exact adapter
        ↓
HTTP / RPC / Plugin / WASM
        ↓
optional CFlow execution
        ↓
ordinary C
~~~

A recurring example in the later chapters is:

~~~text
service UserService {
    GetUser: GetUserRequest -> GetUserResponse;
}
~~~

bound to ordinary C:

~~~c
int get_user(
    UserRepository *repo,
    uint64_t id,
    User *out_user);
~~~

The book shows how that one logical contract can be checked and projected to HTTP, RPC, Plugin, WASM, OpenAPI, and Mock without maintaining six independent API descriptions.

## Four causal stages

### Part I — Native Semantic IR

Start with repeated ordinary C facts and move through Generic, Struct/Enum, Traits, semantic type identity, FunctionDesc, and Callable.

A key distinction is:

~~~text
cmeta_function_desc
    = what the function is

cmeta_callable
    = one admitted executable representation
~~~

Lean is not required to justify this layer.

### Part II — Execution IR

Start with a normal loop and turn the computation into an inspectable graph:

~~~text
Source<int>
    ↓
Filter(is_even)
    ↓
Map(square)
    ↓
Reduce(sum)
~~~

This is where observable semantics, Lean-backed rewrite laws, normalization, optimization, compiled Plans, and Direct/AOT lowering become central.

Every abstraction must eventually show how the hot path returns to ordinary C.

### Part III — Contract IR and the compiler

Start with one C operation that is redundantly described again as an HTTP route, RPC method, plugin export, OpenAPI schema, mock signature, and WASM boundary.

DataBind makes the logical contract explicit with:

~~~text
message / enum / union
service
channel
component
~~~

Then the compiler joins Contract IR with CMeta native semantics:

~~~text
Contract IR
    +
FunctionDesc
    ↓
BindingPlan
    ↓
projection backends
~~~

HTTP / RPC / PLUGIN / WASM / OPENAPI / MOCK are projections, not separate IDL languages.

### Part IV — Live runtime and engineering qualification

This covers Reactive/async I/O, Executor/Scheduler, State Machine, Actor, plugin loading and quiescent unload, CHttp::Server, ABI/Multi-TU, installed consumers, sanitizers, and measurements.

Each runtime chapter must identify which IR it consumes and which metadata has already disappeared before the hot path.

## Editorial method

The rewrite now follows this default sequence:

~~~text
Plain C baseline
    ↓
concrete duplication or ambiguity
    ↓
smallest semantic object
    ↓
C representation
    ↓
compiler/runtime pseudocode
    ↓
flow
    ↓
logic / invariant
    ↓
Lean only if necessary
    ↓
lowered ordinary C
    ↓
failure case
    ↓
evidence
~~~

If an abstraction can only be described as “cleaner”, “more flexible”, or “more modern”, without code, IR, a judgment, a failure rule, or evidence, it is not yet explained.

## Formal methods

Lean is reserved for real semantic obligations such as rewrite preservation, normalization, state determinism, lifecycle invariants, and refinement.

Many compiler rules should first be stated directly:

~~~text
Γ ⊢ field : T
Γ ⊢ param : U
convertible(T, U)
────────────────────
Γ ⊢ bind(field, param) : valid
~~~

ABI, DSO behavior, sanitizers, and performance use compile/link tests, integration tests, sanitizers, and benchmarks respectively.

Chapter filenames are stable source IDs; publication order and visible chapter numbering are defined by each edition's `BOOK_MANIFEST.txt` plus the chapter H1.

## Publication build

The Markdown chapters remain the editable source of truth. Publication order is defined by [BOOK_MANIFEST.txt](./BOOK_MANIFEST.txt).

The release workflow renders HTML, EPUB3, and PDF from the same canonical Markdown manuscript.
